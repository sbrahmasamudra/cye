# [DRAFT] Llama 7B Model Fine-Tuning with Hugging Face on Foundry Cloud Platform

This project demonstrates how to fine-tune the Llama 7B model using Hugging Face’s `transformers` library. The code loads a simple dataset, tokenizes it, and trains the model using the `Trainer` API with mixed precision and gradient accumulation for efficient training.

## Overview

This project fine-tunes the Llama 7B model (`meta-llama/Llama-2-7b-hf`) using a basic text dataset. The script includes tokenization, dataset preparation, and model training using Hugging Face’s `Trainer` API. The training process is optimized with gradient accumulation and mixed precision (`fp16`) for better performance on compatible hardware.

## Setup

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.10+
- CUDA and compatible GPU drivers
- PyTorch and Hugging Face libraries
- FCP Licence

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/llama-finetune.git
    cd llama-finetune
    ```

2. Install the required Python packages:
    ```bash
    pip install torch transformers datasets huggingface_hub
    ```

3. Log in to Hugging Face to access the model:
    ```bash
    huggingface-cli login
    ```

## Data Preparation
The script uses a small, custom dataset for demonstration. The dataset contains simple source and target text pairs:

```python
data = {
    "source_text": ["Hi there", "How are you?", ...],
    "target_text": ["Hello", "I am fine", ...]
}
